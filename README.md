At-a-glance "InfoWall" display for personal use.

Designed for constantly on picoprojector, or any minimal laptop or tablet.
Works best in Chrome; press F11 for Full Screen mode.
Automatically adjusts all elements to window size and rotation to maximize readability.
Weather forecast uses "Wunderground" API.  Speaks the forecast on capable browsers.

Demonstrates a number of advanced Javascript techniques:
  Canvas element and drawing.  Analog clock.
  Text to speech.  JSON fetch and parse.  Weather API use.
  Structured array constant.  Querystring reading.  Use of localstorage.
  Responsive auto-formatting.  Keypress handling.
  Sun/Moon calculations.  Master updater using timer.

NEXT PLANNED ENHANCEMENTS:
1. Add support for NWS (National Weather Service) forecasts (as alternative to Wunderground), using their XML API: http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/
2. Internally animate radar frames (using visibility) and only load new frame every few minutes, rather than constantly reloading the radar image, to reduce  network activity.
