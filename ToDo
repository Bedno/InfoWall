Immediate Planned Work:
* Write a full quick setup guide.
* Sanity check weather response, abort parsing if invalids. Cache best recent parse to local storage. Handles occasional Wunderground.com broken JSON replies having all fields but incomplete values.
* Add more slideshows: US & world cams, stretches, bikes, adult.

Possible future enhancements:
* Periodically recheck Android software market for cheap kiosk browser software.
* Implement configurable overall brightness.
* Add support for NWS (National Weather Service) forecasts (as alternative to Wunderground), using their XML API: http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/
* Implement extensibility. Eventually add Facebook, Twitter, email, SMS, ...
* Personalize using a URL part for user ID. Create minimal AJAX server to save/recall configuration. Create web-based maintenance.
* Add a deadman timer to force reload if running extremely slow, as workaround for memory leaks.
* Add time of day range field to frame records, to configure webcams or art specific to day or night.
