Future possible enhancements:

Internally animate radar frames (using visibility) and only load new frame every few minutes, rather than constantly reloading the radar image, to reduce network activity.

Add a deadman timer to force reload if running extremely slow.  Workaround for Android memory leak problem.

Sanity check all weather JSON response fields, abort parsing if invalids.  Cache best recent parse to local storage.  Handles occassional Wunderground.com weird JSON replies having all fields but incomplete values.

Add support for NWS (National Weather Service) forecasts (as alternative to Wunderground), using their XML API: http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/

Optionally automatically speak the time aloud hourly.  Maybe chime at other intervals.

Automatically speak the weather forecast aloud at programmable intervals or times.  Possibly as alarm.

Implement alarm clock.

Add time of day range field to frame records, to configure webcams or art specific to day or night.

Implement shuffle start for default background which skips considering the shortest frames.

Somehow implement notifications, such as schedule and priorities.
Displayed as a periodic background frame?  Alternating with weather forecast?  Marquee or vertical scrolling over background?
Personalize using a querystring field for user ID.  Create minimal AJAX server to save/recall text blocks.  Create web-based maintenance of text block.
Later implement server processing of email / SMS text for display.
